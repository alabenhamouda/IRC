run the server first with ```java server.Server``` then start the clients  ```java client.Client```. <br>
Only works on linux environments as it uses the stty command to change the terminal mode.<br> If somehow your terminal starts acting weird after running the client program 
run ```stty cooked``` to restore default terminal configs (as I don't really know what I'm doing).
